# React-Tailwind-Components

React-Tailwind-Components is a project built by me as a learning step. I recently stumbled upon TailwindCss and loved it!! Hence practicing it by building UI componets  as often as I can. This initial release contains 3 Card templates.

### Installation

The tool requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
